## Homework 1 - frogs
Assume a sequence of rocks in a river, a total of 2n+1, ordered in a line. The first n rocks have frogs facing right and the last n have frogs facing to the left. A rock can host <= 1 frogs on it. The goal is to swap the frogs such that all frogs face towards the end they're closest to. Frogs can only move in the direction they're looking and can't turn around. They can either jump a distance of 1 rock or jump over another (1) frog at the empty rock.
## Homework 2 - sliding puzzle
For a square grid of size N, given input is k = N^2 - 1. Numbers from 0 to k are given as input in an arbitrary order with 0 representing the empty slot. The index of the empty tile in the solution is the second given input. The purpose of the game is to sort the tiles from left to right, top to bottom. Using Manhattan distance as a heuristic, find the shortest solution using IDA* if one exists, otherwise print out -1.
